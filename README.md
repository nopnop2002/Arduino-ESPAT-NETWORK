# Arduino-ESPAT-TCP   
MQTT/NTP/SMTP/SNTP/TCP/UDP Applicaton for Arduino using ESP8266's AT firmware.   
You don't need Ethernet card.   
You need only ESP8266 module.   

# Memory usage
__Saves Flash and SRAM__   

_UNO+ENC28J60+UIPEthernet+PubSubClient_

```
Sketch uses 25090 bytes (77%) of program storage space. Maximum is 32256 bytes.
Global variables use 1736 bytes (84%) of dynamic memory, leaving 312 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2048 bytes.
Low memory available, stability problems may occur.

# Hardware requirements   
- ESP8266 module like ESP01   
 ESP8266 has 1MB FLASH and 4MB FLASH (or more) SoCs, but it doesn't matter.

- ATmega328/ATmega2560/STM32

- UART-USB converter

# Software requirements   
- Arduino Environment   
 Core library is required when using STM32.   
 It supports Maple cores and ST cores.   

- ESP8266 AT Firmware   
 AT firmware version can be identified by AT version and SDK version.   
 AT version V2 added MQTT and HTTP commands.   
 However, AT version V2 does not support 1M SoCs like ESP01.   
 When using 1M SoCs like ESP01, it is necessary to use AT version V1.   
 This repository works with both V1 and V2.   
 You can download AT version V1 from [here](https://github.com/espressif/ESP8266_NONOS_SDK/tags).   
 __Note__   
 Some firmware here does not support 1M SoC such as ESP01.   
 I used this.

# Flash AT firmware to ESP01.   
The 3.3V output of the UART-USB converter has too little current to be used.   
Power is supplied using 5V from the UART-USB converter and 3.3V from the regulator.   
- GPIO2 must be pulled up.   
- GPIO0 must be connected to GND.   
- CH_PD must be pulled up.   
- RESET must be pulled up.   

See [here](https://github.com/nopnop2002/Arduino-ESPAT-TCP/tree/master/Flash_AT_firmware) for details..

Re-Connect to ESP01 with 4800 bps.   

AT firmware has a function that automatically connects to the last connected AP when the module is reset.   
Using this function, you can omit the SSID and password.   

```

# UART to WiFi module   
We can get a module for UART communication.   
We can write AT firmware to this.   
Although it supplies 5V power, the TTL level of UART is 3.3V.

# ESP01 Adapter board
Only $1 for AliExpress/eBay.   
External pin header is 5V,GND,TXD,RXD.   
It has a 5V->3.3V regulator and can supply power directly from UNO's 5V.   
Although it supplies 5V power, the TTL level of UART is 3.3V.   
![ESP01-Adapter-3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6020549/120063987-f3a86100-c0a4-11eb-95e4-c87164812af4.JPG)

# Use with TFT Shield   
UNO compatibles can have a pin header inside the pin socket.   
If you do not use SD-CARD, you can freely use digital pins # 10 to # 13 of the TFT shield.   
These pins can be used for UART communication with the ESP01.
